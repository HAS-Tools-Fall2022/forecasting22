# Map Gallery Scripts
This folder contains the scripts that accompany our [map gallery]https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Vx_A2FNrRM-08SPloBi5PI6AXIRu9lNdMyihj0gkxdE/edit?usp=sharing)

Please add the script that generates your map to this folder.

- Your script should be named `lastname_map.py`
- Your script should be well commented, follow pep8 standards and be easy to follow.
- **Do not** upload the datasets for your map to the repo. Its okay if your script wont run from the forecast repo because its pointing to files you have locally.
- For each file you use include a comment with a link for where you got it.
- This script should include only what is necessary to generate the map you submitted to the gallery. Don't include your forecast analysis here.
